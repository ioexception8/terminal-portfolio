### Overview

Key loggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your data. The software is installed on your computer and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to use all this sensitive information.

<h4>This key logger can not only detect & record your keystrokes but can also:</h4>

- Takes screenshot at a particular interval of time
- Records audio
- Record your System‚Äôs information & IP Address
- Sends the data to the remote server using Twilio
- Keep track of your clipboard information

### Major Accomplishments

- It will broaden the way of thinking of researchers about how we can innovate the key loggers.
- It will help identify the loopholes in the current anti key loggers software.
- Multi software hack: pyKeylogger is packed with many modules to make it more advance than traditional keyloggers.
