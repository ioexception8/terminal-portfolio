### Overview

<h4>Codemania is an online compiler that provides the following features:</h4></br>
Code completion using ChatGPT - users can search for questions and generate code using artificial intelligence.</br>
Analyze results and statistics using the "tremor.so" dashboard using bar chart.</br>
YouTube video recommendation at a one-stop place with user authentication.</br>
Compile your code in C, C++, and Python and get the output with an easy-to-use interface.</br></br>

### Major Accomplishments

- User cannot access Dashboard and Analytics unless and until they sign in. We handled private routes with care so that we can match a production ready authentication in the given time frame.
- The data for the analytics is fetched from Supabase Database. We are successful in integrating the Supabase Database Service. Thanks to the documentation!
